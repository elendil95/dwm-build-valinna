.SH NAME
dwm \- dynamic window manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dwm
.RB [ \-v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dwm 
is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, monocle
and floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimising the
environment for the application in use and the task performed.
.P
In tiled layouts windows are managed in a master and stacking area. The master
area on the left contains one window by default, and the stacking area on the
right contains all other windows. The number of master area windows can be
adjusted from zero to an arbitrary number. In monocle layout all windows are
maximised to the screen size. In floating layout windows can be resized and
moved freely. Dialog windows are always managed floating, regardless of the
layout applied.
.P
Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or multiple
tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.
.P
Each screen contains a small status bar which displays all available tags, the
layout, the title of the focused window, and the text read from the root window
name property, if the screen is focused. A floating window is indicated with an
empty square and a maximised floating window is indicated with a filled square
before the windows title.  The selected tags are indicated with a different
color. The tags of the focused window are indicated with a filled square in the
top left corner.  The tags which are applied to one or more windows are
indicated with an empty square in the top left corner.
.P
dwm draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state.

.TP
.B Mod\-[1..n]
View all windows with nth tag.
.TP
.B Mod\-Shift\-[1..n]
Apply nth tag to focused window.
.TP
.B Mod\-Control\-[1..n]
View/Hide all windows with tag n on the current tag.
.IP
.I Explanation: 
Pressing Mod\-Shift\-1 while the user is on tag (workspace) 8, will show the contents of tag 1 in tag 8. 
.TP
.B Mod\-Control\-Shift\-[1..n]
Add/remove nth tag to/from focused window.
.IP
.I Explanation: 
This key combination allws the user to tag the focused window with a secondary tag, 
such that it will always show up on both tags. For example if we spawn a terminal
on tag 1 and we press Mod\-Control\-Shift\-8, that terminal will live on both tags 1 and 8.
.IP
.I Note: 
Doing this does not spawn a second terminal, it will simply show the same terminal in multiple tag: closing the terminal on either tag 1 or 8 will close the other "instance" as well.

.SH ISSUES
Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey windows
only. The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks ICCCM-compliance in recent JDK 1.5 and early
JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a reparenting window manager. Possible workarounds
are using JDK 1.4 (which doesn't contain the XToolkit/XAWT backend) or setting the
environment variable
.BR AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
(to use the older Motif backend instead) or running
.B xprop -root -f _NET_WM_NAME 32a -set _NET_WM_NAME LG3D
or
.B wmname LG3D
(to pretend that a non-reparenting window manager is running that the
XToolkit/XAWT backend can recognize) or when using OpenJDK setting the environment variable
.BR _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 .
